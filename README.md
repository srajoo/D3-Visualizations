# Dataset

The data set was sourced from the UN Data bank and contains data regarding International Gross Domestic Product (in millions of US dollars). The dataset has the following information:

Country/Region
Year : 1995, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019
Series:
GDP at current prices
GDP per capita
GDP at constant 2010 prices
GDP real rates of growth (percent)
Values corresponding to each of the series.
For this project, I created a subset from the original dataset by filtering on GDP per capita (in millions of US Dollars) for 10 countries for 2019.

The cleaned data can be found under the data folder as a json file.

The 10 countries valuated for this assignment are:
<ol>
<li>Anguilla</li>
<li>Denmark</li>
<li>Finland</li>
<li>Iceland</li>
<li>Puerto Rico</li>
<li>Saudi Arabia</li>
<li>Singapore</li>
<li>Spain</li>
<li>Switzerland</li>
<li>United Arab Emirates</li>
